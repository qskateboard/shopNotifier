# shopNotifier

This is a web panel with a plug-in for the Arizona RP server (GTA:SAMP), which helps to trade on the local market and analyze all monetary transactions.

The LUA script itself is called ShopNotifier.lua, in which you need to set the domain of the web panel in order for the client and server to be connected.

It is also necessary to place a token for the telegram bot in the code in order for alerts to work (Yes, I did not take it out separately in the settings, because it was a test project that was quickly abandoned due to irrelevance)
